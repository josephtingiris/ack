PRE-REQUISITES

yum install genisoimage isomd5sum syslinux

SETUP

There must be a 'media' directory with sufficient permissions for apache to read from it.  Typically, this is put on another filesystem due to the fact it can consume quite a bit of space.  This is where the ISOs, VMs, etc. are stored.

# mkdir -p media/build media/distribution media/release media/vm

CREATE ACK-MEDIA

1) Download original media iso & put it in media/distribution

https://www.centos.org/download/

# mv ~jtingiris/Downloads/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso media/distribution/


2) Create the boot media

# sbin/ack-media -b CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1810.iso -s dev-ack.domain.com
